*This project is to develop strabismus diagnostic software for use in ophthalmology.*

*Strabismus is a condition in which the eyes do not properly align with each other when looking at an object. The eye which is focused on an object can alternate. The condition may be present occasionally or constantly. If present during a large part of childhood, it may result in amblyopia or loss of depth perception. If onset is during adulthood, it is more likely to result in double vision.*

*Strabismus is expressed in various types, and according to eye movement, it is classified into esotropia, exotropia, hypertropia and hypotropia. Currently, in ophthalmology, ophthalmologists diagnose the strabismus with the naked eye, but it is very difficult to diagnose strabismus unless a strabismus specialist. However, not all hospitals have strabismus specialists, so many ophthalmologists are currently struggling with strabismus diagnosis. So our goal is to develop software that automatically diagnoses strabismus. We are receiving data from some ophthalmologists and are thinking about using deep learning to solve this problem. We will experiment with various models such as MLP, RNN, GRU, LSTM, CNN, LSTM-CNN, Transformer and so on. and if all models do not perform well, we will construct a new model.*

*Random cross validation was conducted for the experiment. 
Firstly, we ramdomly select 178 patients' data (90%) 
from a total of 198 patients and proceed model training. 
After that, 20 patients' data (10%) that have not been trained are selected for diagnosis. 
In each experiment, we create and experiment with a total of 10 new models, 
and evaluate the minimum and average accuracy of the 10 models as the 
performance of the model.*

Experimental results from traditional machine learning models. 
Even with the data added, the performance of the ensemble models 
(Bagging & Boosting) is the highest. In addition, we experimented 
with the XGBoost model, which shows performance similar 
to Gradient Boosting or Random Forest. (About 80% accuracy)
